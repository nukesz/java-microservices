Compare java microservices

## Motivation

Today is hard to choose between java libraries/frameworks to build a new microservice.
This repository is intended to help people to oversee what's currently available on the market and compare those.

With this comparison people can immaterially see what's the difference between the libraries and can choose what fits best for them.
